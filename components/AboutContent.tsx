              <p>
                My name is Allan Gelman. I am an software engineer and artist
                with passions for passions for web development, AR/VR, and 3D
                modeling.
              </p>
              <p>
                I graduated from MIT in 2020, where I completed an
                interdisciplinary major called Humanities and Engineering
                (combining Comparative Media Studies and Computer Science).
              </p>
              <p>
                Afterwards, I spent a year developing my 3D modeling skills
                through courses at the vocational online art school CGMA
                (Computer Graphics Master Academy), which lead me to working as
                a software engineer at Clay, a startup building a web
                application for 3D modeling collaboration. At Clay, I was able
                combine my artistic and technical passions while learning web
                development!
              </p>
              <p>
                Now, I am working as a software engineer apprentice at LinkedIn,
                diving deeper into my passion for backend engineering on the
                Infrastructure as Code team!
